Design current system such that in the future another display board in close proximity can be installed using existing processing unit at site. 
Allow for expansion of solar power and battery backup systems to support additional modules on the secondary display board. 
Data communication between boards may be wired or wireless within a distance of up to 200m maximum.  
An underground-wired system is preferred to enable shared power supply and data communication to avoid additional wireless systems and 
prevent interference with high gain satellite antenna.
